**** BUILDING A PHASER GAME WITH PHYSICS *******

Figuring out the rules of a video game is a one of the joys of starting a new game. 
- we wonder how fast our character can go, or how high it jumps , or what happens when it touches an enemy sprite.
- as a game developer, implementing these rules is about deciding the physics of our game.

- the physics of a game determines how GameObjects interact with the game world. 

((( Phaser provides built-in physics plugins to create a game with set rules & interactions )));
